                The sudden death of a dear grandfather has brought us the understanding of what paul says in Philipians 2:21, that says "For me to live is christ and to die is gain."Sokoro" as we used to call you, We miss you so much, we miss the moments we shared together.You are the best grandfather anyone would wish to have.The emptiness of space you have left in our lives is so deep, It will be difficult to fill.You left without saying goodbye, for this reason we dear longingly into light and darkness hoping for the last glimpse so that even as you rest in peace, we may also have peace.

                Little did i know that morning that God was going to call your name.In life we loved you dearly, in death we do the same.It broke our hearts to lose you,you did not go alone; for part of us went with you, the day God called you home.You left us peaceful memories, your love is still our guide; and though we cannot see you, you are always at our side. Our family chain is broken, and nothing seems the same but as God call us one by one, the chain will link again
